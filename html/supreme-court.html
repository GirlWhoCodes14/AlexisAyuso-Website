            <p>The Supreme Court is in my home of Belize City, Belize. It is a landmark and historical building. 
                This model was created using <a href="https://www.sketchup.com/en">SketchUp</a>, and it only contains the outer structure because the property is not accessible to the public.
            </p>

            <p>This project began when my virtual reality professor assigned the class to create a building using SketchUp. We were given free range to remake any building. I chose a structure that reminded me of home and that I wanted to live in prosperity digitally. I am proud to showcase my model because I put a lot of love into rebuilding the intricate details that restore the building to its optimal presentation in digital form.
            </p>

            <p>Built in 1926, the <a href="https://www.travelbelize.org/attraction/belize-supreme-court/">Belize Supreme Court building</a> was rebuilt in the same style as the previous one that burned down in 1918.</p>

            <p>According to <a href="https://belizing.com/Belize-Supreme-Court/">belizing.com</a>, “The Supreme Court building is known for its filigreed iron stairs, its balcony rails, and its four-sided clock. The stairs are made of wrought iron, and they are decorated with intricate patterns. The balcony rails are also made of wrought iron, and they are decorated with flowers and vines. The four-sided clock is located on the top of the building, and it is visible from all over Belize City.”

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>I wanted a detailed and realistic model, which required a lot of trial and error. I remade many parts of the building to ensure it was up to my high standards. Many components were used to speed up the development process. Since the building has many windows, a lot of attention was given to forming the variations of windows on the building.

            <p>Although the model is realistic and true to the fundamental style of the building, it is a clean remake of an old building, so it does not show the wear and tear of years of use and prosperity.
